𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 .𝗡𝗘𝗧 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 .𝗔𝘀𝗦𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆() 🚀

If you’ve ever watched an EF Core query crawl to a halt trying to load tons of related data at once, I’ve got great news: .𝗔𝘀𝗦𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆() 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽!

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗴, 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝘃𝘆 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 🏗️
By default, EF Core tries to fetch all related data in a single, massive query when you use .𝘐𝘯𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘥𝘦(). It’s like attempting to grab every item on your grocery list in one trip—sure, it’s one shot, but it might slow you down if the bag is too heavy!

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗦𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝘁 𝗨𝗽! ✂️
.𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺() breaks that one giant query into multiple, smaller queries. That means:
𝗙𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Smaller queries tend to run more quickly.
𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗨𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲: No more dealing with huge result sets all at once.
𝗘𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴: Multiple simpler queries are easier to understand and optimize.

See It in Action! 👀

Check out the carousel to compare the code and the resulting SQL outputs. You’ll see:

Before .𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺(): One giant query trying to return everything at once.
After .𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺(): Multiple, leaner queries that fetch data in smaller chunks.

By moving through the images in the carousel, you’ll spot the difference in both the C# code and the underlying SQL. It’s a clear illustration of how .𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺() can turn a performance bottleneck into a breeze!

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗜𝘁?
If your EF Core queries feel slow or bloated, give .𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺() a try. It’s a quick fix that can bring a big boost in responsiveness—no more struggling under the weight of giant queries!

In a nutshell: .𝘈𝘴𝘚𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺() makes your queries leaner, faster, and easier to manage. ✨
